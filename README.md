# Miwok
This is an Android app I made to learn more on Android and how apps are made on the Android platform. I made this app with the help of an amazing Android course on Udacity.

## Info
This app teaches users about the Miwok language. It features four tabs that separate different categories a user can learn about. In each tab, there are views that show an image, Miwok text and its english translation. Additionally, pressing on a view plays an audio telling the user how to pronounce the words.

## Some nice images of the app
